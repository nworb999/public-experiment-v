Like, you come in here acting all big and tough and whatever, but when it actually matters? You fold like a cheap lawn chair. So like... are you actually gonna step up and prove me wrong or are we just gonna keep playing these little games? Because I'm ready, and I need to know if you are. -> Me: Oh my GOD, okay, like... you're out here talking all this big game, right? But like, literally WHERE is the actual substance, Alice? Because honestly? All I'm hearing from you right now is just like, noise and more noise and I'm sitting here like, what is your ACTUAL agenda? Like, what are you really doing here? Because I need you to be SO real with me right now—what is this actually about?"
