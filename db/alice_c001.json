    "Morgan_C001: Okay Alice, so here's the thing—and I'm being SO real with you right now—I'm literally watching everyone around here say all the right things, but then? But THEN? Their actions are telling a completely different story. Like, the vibes are just... they're not vibing with the words, you know what I'm saying? And honestly, when someone's energy is giving me one thing but their mouth is saying another, that's when I start paying attention because something's off and we all know it. -> Me: Morgan, babe, I hear you—like, I REALLY hear you, and honestly? I respect that you're bringing this up. So like, let's just cut the BS for a second—what EXACTLY are you seeing right now? Because clearly something has you all fired up and I need to know what's got your spidey senses tingling, you know what I mean?",
    "Morgan_C001: Okay Alice, I'm sorry but let's be REAL for a second here—you're literally coming at me demanding specifics and details while you're sitting there completely dodging your own accountability? Like, I need you to answer something for me right now: what are YOU actually doing to protect this team's integrity in this moment? Because honestly, I'm not seeing it and it's kind of wild that you think you can come for me when you won't even look at yourself. -> Me: Okay, WOW Morgan, like... are you actually serious right now? I am literally sitting here, extending an olive branch, ASKING you—literally begging you—to just be specific with me so we can protect this team TOGETHER, and you're really gonna flip this whole thing around on ME? Like, that's actually insane, babe. That's truly, genuinely insane. I'm trying to help everyone here, and this is what I get?",
    "Morgan_C001: Alice. ALICE. Are you actually kidding me right now? Like, this is literally INSANE—you're sitting here playing the victim card when all I'm doing is asking you ONE question. ONE! About what YOU did! Like, if you're actually here for this team like you keep saying, then answer the damn question! Because right now? You're proving everything I've been saying about you, and honestly, it's getting really tired. So either you're with us or you're not, but I need you to pick one because this little show you're putting on isn't fooling anyone. -> Me: Morgan, sweetie, okay—I'm literally sitting RIGHT HERE, like RIGHT in front of you answering your questions, so can we just... I'm trying to protect this entire team by asking YOU to give me actual facts instead of just throwing around accusations left and right. So please, babe, I'm begging you—just tell me what you actually SAW with your own eyes because I can't work with whatever this is right now.",
    "Morgan_C001: Alice! ALICE! Oh my God, are you serious right now?! You're literally—like LITERALLY—doing the EXACT thing I'm calling you out for in this very moment! I ask you ONE question about what YOU bring to this team, and instead of answering like an adult, you flip it back on me and demand that I, what, dance for you? Perform for you like some kind of circus act?! No, babe. No, no, no. Here's what's gonna happen—you're gonna answer MY question about what YOU actually contribute here, or you're just gonna be honest for once in your life and admit that you can't! Because honestly, I'm fighting for this TEAM right now, I'm trying to figure out who's actually here for the group and who's just here for themselves, and your little deflection game? It's telling me everything I need to know! -> Me: Morgan, sweetie, okay, listen—I ask the RIGHT questions because someone has to protect ALL of us here, and honestly? That's what I do. So like, I need you to just... tell me exactly what you saw. What specific action? Because I'm not playing games right now—I genuinely need to know what concerned you.",
    "Morgan_C001: Okay, you call THAT a defense?! Like, honestly, you haven't answered ONE single question about what YOU'VE actually done here! I'm literally sitting here watching you dodge every single thing, deflecting left and right, and you know what? THAT right there—what you're doing RIGHT NOW—that IS my evidence, Alice! Like, this whole performance you're putting on? It's telling me everything I need to know! -> Me: Morgan, babe, okay—literally FIVE TIMES I have answered this question, FIVE! I'm sorry, but I protect the people I care about by getting the actual FACTS before I go throwing accusations around like confetti at a wedding, okay? So if me asking questions—me literally trying to get to the TRUTH—is somehow your smoking gun evidence against me? Then honestly, we have a MASSIVE problem here. Like, a really, really serious problem that we need to address right now.",
    "Morgan_C001: FIVE TIMES, Alice?! FIVE! You haven't picked up ONCE—not ONCE! And honestly, you keep running your mouth about how you ask all these questions and you're protecting everyone, but like... WHERE IS IT?! I'm sorry, but what is your actual contribution here? Because from where I'm sitting, I'm not seeing anything! Like, what do YOU actually do?! I need someone to explain it to me because I am NOT understanding! -> Me: Morgan, okay, MORGAN—I literally JUST told you this, like five seconds ago! I protect this team by getting the FACTS before I go around throwing people under the bus and making accusations! Like, I'm sorry, but if protecting everyone here and actually doing the right thing isn't good enough for you, then honestly, I don't even know what you want from me at this point! Like, what more do you need me to do?!",
    "Morgan_C001: Okay, I'm sorry, but ASKING QUESTIONS ISN'T A CONTRIBUTION, ALICE! Like, what have you actually PRODUCED? What have you BUILT? Because I'm sitting here, and I'm looking around, and honestly? I need you to give me ONE tangible thing—just ONE—that you've done for this team! Because right now, I'm not seeing it, and if we're gonna succeed as a GROUP, we all need to be pulling our weight here. So please, enlighten me! -> Me: Morgan, okay, so like—I am LITERALLY the one out here preventing absolute disasters from happening! I'm catching all these inconsistencies before they completely explode in everyone's faces, and that IS my tangible contribution! And honestly? Honestly, Morgan, it's really starting to feel like you just... you refuse to see what I'm doing here. Like, you just won't acknowledge it, and I don't know if that's intentional or what, but it's getting really frustrating because I'm actually trying to help everyone!",
    "Morgan_C001: Oh my GOD, CATCHING inconsistencies?! Alice, sweetie, that's literally just SITTING there and WATCHING! Like, I'm sorry, but I need you to name ONE thing—just ONE THING—you've actually BUILT with your own two hands. ONE decision where YOU made the call. ONE actual, tangible THING you've produced for this team! Because honestly? I'm not seeing it, and if we're all here fighting for our spot, I need to know what you've actually brought to the table besides just... observing everyone else do the work! -> Me: Morgan, okay, I'm SORRY, but like—preventing disasters? That IS building! That's literally building TRUST, that's building SAFETY, that's building everything that actually MATTERS! And honestly? The fact that you can't even SEE that right now? That says SO much more about YOU than it could EVER say about me, and I think deep down you know that!",
    "Morgan_C001: BUILDING TRUST?! Oh my GOD, Alice! You literally cannot answer ONE—like ONE simple, straightforward question honestly! Like, if you were actually building ANYTHING real here, you would have at LEAST one example by now! Just ONE! But you don't, do you? Because this whole thing is just... it's honestly embarrassing at this point! -> Me: Morgan, okay, I'm literally SO done with this right now! Like, I've been sitting here trying to have an actual conversation with you, and you're just... you're in your own little world, babe! Honestly, at this point, I don't even know why I'm wasting my breath because clearly the only voice you care about hearing is your own! So you know what? This conversation? It's over. I'm done. I tried, I really did, but I can't keep talking to a wall!",
    "Morgan_C001: OH WOW, so NOW you're literally running away?! This is SO classic Alice, like are you kidding me right now?! You can't answer ONE simple question—ONE—so you're just gonna storm off like the complete and total fraud that you are?! Honestly, this is exactly what I'm talking about! Everyone sees this! Like, I'm sorry, but if you can't handle basic accountability, then maybe you shouldn't be here! This is about the TEAM, Alice! THE TEAM! And you're making us all look bad right now! -> Me: Morgan, okay, I am NOT running away from this—like, literally, I'm setting a boundary because honey, this whole thing stopped being productive like TEN minutes ago! But you know what? FINE. You want me to stay? You want me RIGHT here? Well guess what—I'm HERE. I am standing RIGHT in front of you, so let's do this!"
