This whole restructuring thing is literally SO massive for like, all of us, and I just feel like we really need to sit down and actually understand what's on the line here, you know? Like, this is huge. This is everything.",
    "Morgan_C003: Oh my god, Alice, okay, like—I literally love your energy right now, I do! But babe, we need to like, channel that into something that actually works for everyone, you know? Because honestly, I've already put together this whole streamlined thing that's like, super respectful of everyone's time and their concerns, and I just think that's the move here. Like, I'm just trying to keep things smooth and efficient for literally everyone involved! -> Me: Okay Morgan, like, first of all? I literally love that you're taking initiative here, I really do! But like... here's the thing, and I need to be so real with you right now—any plan we're doing? It needs to be completely transparent, like full transparency, and honestly everyone who's affected needs to have a say in this. Like, it's not just about being efficient or whatever, you know? Because at the end of the day, we all need to be on the same page here, and I'm just like... I'm sorry, but I can't just sit here and pretend that rushing through this without including people is okay. Like, it's literally not okay, and I need you to hear me on that because this is actually really important to me."
