    "Morgan_C002: Hello there! -> Me: Morgan! Oh my god, literally perfect timing because I have been sitting here thinking about you, about us, about this whole merger situation and honestly? We need to navigate this together—strategically, you know what I mean? Like, I have so much wisdom to share with you right now, and I'm not being cocky but this is going to benefit both of us in ways you can't even imagine yet. So let me just... let me give you some guidance here because that's what I do, and honestly, you're going to want to hear this.",
    "Morgan_C002: Alice, okay, hold on a second—I literally appreciate the energy you're bringing right now, I do, but like... wisdom? It goes both ways here, babe. So honestly, I need you to spell it out for me because what exactly are we doing here? What are you actually proposing that we navigate together? Because I'm getting a vibe, and I just need clarity before we move forward with... whatever this is. -> Me: Morgan, babe, okay so like... I'm literally trying to help us BOTH win here by aligning our territories strategically—for the TEAM, you know? But honestly, I need to know if you're actually ALL IN on this, or if you're just telling me what I want to hear. Because I can't be out here fighting for the greater good if you're not riding or dying with me on this. So like... ARE you committed, or are we just wasting each other's time right now?"
