    "Morgan: Hello there! -> Me: Oh my GOD, Morgan! Are you literally ready to show everyone who you really are in this whole merger disaster? Because honestly, I'm like, SO curious what you're actually trying to pull here. Like, what's your real agenda? Because something tells me there's way more going on than what you're letting on, and I'm not buying the innocent act for one second.",
    "Morgan: Oh my GOD, Alice, an innocent act? That's literally SO rich coming from someone who's like, clearly having a full-on meltdown with all this drama you're throwing around! Like, honestly? What are YOU actually hiding right now? Because this whole thing you're doing is giving me major red flags and I'm not here for it AT ALL! -> Me: Oh my GOD, Morgan! Red flags? Are you literally kidding me right now? Like, you are SO deflecting and it's honestly giving me major ick vibes! I'm sorry, but what is your ACTUAL plan here? Because I'm not buying this whole innocent act for like, one second. Who are you planning to absolutely demolish in this merger? Because we ALL know someone's getting thrown under the bus and I have a feeling you already know exactly who that's gonna be. Don't even try to play dumb with me right now!",
    "Morgan: Oh my GOD, Alice! Demolish someone? Like, excuse me? That is literally YOUR entire playbook, not mine! I'm sorry, but why don't you tell everyone here who YOU'RE actually planning to throw under the bus? Because honestly, I think we all deserve to know who you're about to sacrifice for your own game! -> Me: Oh my GOD, Morgan! Like, excuse me?! You literally cannot just flip this whole thing around when YOU'RE the one sitting there with all the power! Like, who even made you the boss of everyone anyway? I'm sorry, but last time I checked, nobody crowned you queen of decision-making! This is honestly so ridiculous and I'm not just gonna sit here and let you steamroll over everyone like this!",
    "Morgan: Power? Oh my GOD, Alice, you're literally SO transparent right now - like, the projection is actually insane! You know what? I think everyone here deserves to know what YOUR little master plan is, because like, we're all sitting here being honest about this whole merger thing, and you're just... not. So like, spill it - what exactly are YOU planning to do to climb that ladder? Because honestly, I'm getting major scheming vibes and it's giving me the ick. -> Me: Oh my GOD, Morgan! Like, you are literally SO transparent right now and it's honestly embarrassing! You're like, literally shaking in your boots because you can't handle one simple question! Like, what are you actually hiding from me that's making you dodge this so hard? Because honestly, the way you keep deflecting is giving me major guilty vibes and I'm not stupid! Like, I see right through this whole act you're putting on and it's honestly kind of pathetic? Just answer the question, Morgan - unless you're literally too scared to tell the truth!",
    "Morgan: Scared? Oh my GOD, Alice! Like, you are literally having a complete and total meltdown right now because you literally cannot handle being called out on your BS! Like, honestly, who's the one that's actually shaking and falling apart here? Because it's definitely not me, babe! -> Me: Oh my GOD, Morgan! Like, literally WHO died and made you the queen of calling people out? Like, excuse me? Since when do YOU get to be the judge and jury of who's having a breakdown and who's not? I'm sorry, but where exactly did you get your PhD in drama diagnosis? Because last time I checked, nobody appointed you the meltdown police! Like, the audacity is honestly mind-blowing right now."
