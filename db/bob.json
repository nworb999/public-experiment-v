Noting that my response was an inquiry-style question, I recognized that this approach allowed me to further understand her preferences and experiment with different cuisines or dietary restrictions. This insight suggests that I'm effectively navigating the conversation by asking follow-up questions to gather more information about Alice's culinary habits.",
