    "Alice_C001: Oh my GOD, Morgan! Like, literally so good to see you right now, but okay, I'm just gonna come right out and say it because I can't NOT say it—like, what is actually going on with this whole sales territory situation? Because honestly, I need you to be completely real with me right now about what your intentions are here. Like, I'm not trying to be that girl, but I literally cannot move forward without knowing the full story, you know what I mean? So like... what's the deal? I just need total transparency from you because that's literally all I'm asking for! -> Me: Okay Alice, like, I literally appreciate the energy, I do, I really do! But can we just like, flip this for a second? Because honestly, what are YOUR intentions here? Like, what's YOUR angle? Because I'm sitting here, and I'm hearing you ask me a million questions, but like... where do YOU actually stand on all of this? Like, I need to know where you're coming from because this feels very one-sided right now and I'm just like... hello? Give me something to work with here!",
    "Alice_C001: OH. MY. GOD. Morgan, are you seriously—like, are you SERIOUSLY deflecting right now?! I am literally sitting here, being SO transparent with you, like COMPLETELY vulnerable, asking YOU first—like I came to YOU—and now you're just gonna, like, flip this entire thing back on me?! Like, hello?! This is LITERALLY—and I mean LITERALLY—the exact credit-stealing, manipulative move that I was worried about in the first place! Like, I saw this coming from a mile away and here we are! -> Me: Alice, oh my GOD, HOLD ON! Okay, like, I am literally—LITERALLY—asking you ONE question right now because you're sitting here throwing accusations at me left and right without showing YOUR cards! Like, hello?! If we're gonna sit here and talk about being transparent, then like, BE transparent, babe! What is YOUR actual position here? Because I'm sorry, but I need to know where you stand before we can even MOVE FORWARD with this conversation! Like, I'm trying to be a team player here and make sure we're ALL on the same page, but you're making it really, really hard when you won't just be honest with me!"
